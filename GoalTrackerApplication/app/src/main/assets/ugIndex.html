            Welcome to my Goals Tracker app by Joshua Watley! This app is made to help a uni student, or any adult for that matter with organising work or tasks that they have to do on a day to day basis.
            
        </p>
        <p>
            The premise of this app is the idea of visually seeing what you have to do right there on your phone and being able to clearly see what is done, to be done and in progress. 
            
        </p>

            <i>
            *This app gets alot of its functionality from google sign in - without google sign in, you have to sign in every time you close the app! The test account is eee as username eee as password - in full release there will only be an option to sign in with google as the default entry is there for lecturer testing purposes*
